Create a new file, e.g. `mueller_2020.yaml` in `src/papers`. The content of the file should look like this:

```yaml
ISBN: '9781450322430'

```

A file for each author must be available in `src/authors`.

## Add an Author

Create a new file, e.g. `mueller_jill.yaml` in `src/authors`. The content of the file should look like this:

```yaml

```

The authors can now be reference by using the file name without the extensions. So in our example: `mueller_jill`

```yaml
_meta:
    title: Bloom's Taxonomy

comprehension:
    _meta:
        description: >
            Comprehension involves demonstrating an understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, summarizing, translating, generalizing, giving descriptions, and stating the main ideas. 
application:
    _meta:
        description: >
            Application involves using acquired knowledgeâ€”solving problems in new situations by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules. Learners should be able to use prior knowledge to solve problems, identify connections and relationships and how they apply in new situations. 
analysis:
    _meta:
        description: >
            Analysis involves examining and breaking information into component parts, determining how the parts relate to one another, identifying motives or causes, making inferences, and finding evidence to support generalizations.
synthesis:
    _meta:
        description: >
            Synthesis involves building a structure or pattern from diverse elements; it also refers to the act of putting parts together to form a whole.
evaluation:
    _meta:
        description: >
            Evaluation involves presenting and defending opinions by making judgments about information, the validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria.

## Linting

You can check if everything went right and the links between the documents are correct by running `pipenv run lint`. If you want to continuously check for errors or warning you can run `pipenv run lint -w`.
