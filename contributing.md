## Paper Requirements and Categories

Papers are divided into two main categories:

- Assessment papers: Papers, which present new programming assessments 
- Assist papers: Papers, which validate a given assessment or just use it

A assessment paper will be linked to one of the following categories:

- :sunglasses: (awesome): The assessment needs ot be publicly available
- :smiley: (great): Example items need to be presented and the author will send the assessment on request
- :blush: (good): The author will send the assessment on request
- :confused: (neutral): An assessment is presented, but it is not available to the public or on request and no example items are shown

A assist paper will be linked to one of the following categories:

- :dart: (validates/replicates): A assessment is validated, the results of an assessment are replicated
- :tea: (uses): A assessment is just used

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
