## Assessment Requirements and Categories

An assessment will be linked to one of the following categories:

- :sunglasses: (awesome): The assessment needs to be publicly available
- :smiley: (great): Example items need to be presented and the author will send the assessment on request
- :blush: (good): The author will send the assessment on request
- :confused: (neutral): An assessment is presented in a paper, but it is not available to the public or on request and no example items are shown

If a link to the assessment or the paper presenting the assessment exists, it should be provided.

## Paper Requirements and Categories

A paper will be linked to one of the following categories:

- :dart: (validates/replicates): An assessment is validated, the results of an assessment are replicated
- :memo: (uses): An assessment is used
- :clapper: (presents): An assessment is introduced/presented

A paper should only be linked to one cateogry. If a paper for example is introduced/presented and validated in the same paper,
the paper should be considered for :dart: (validates/replicates).

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
