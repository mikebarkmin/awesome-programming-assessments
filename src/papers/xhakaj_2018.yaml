abstract: 'Computer programming is becoming important in almost every profession.
  However, programming is still difficult for students to learn. In this work, we
  focus on helping students acquire strong conceptual and procedural knowledge of
  programing. We propose to create a new Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that will
  support students in two types of conceptually-oriented activities: code tracing
  and code comprehension. Further, we propose to run a study to evaluate whether the
  ITS can support students'' conceptual learning and transfer to procedural learning
  of computer programming.'
