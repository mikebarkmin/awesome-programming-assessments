abstract: If a MOOC is to qualify for equal credit as an existing on-campus offering,
  students must achieve comparable outcomes, both educational and attitudinal. We
  have built a MOOC for teaching CS1 with the intent of offering it for degree credit.
  To test its eligibility for credit, we delivered it as an online for-credit course
  for two semesters to 197 on-campus students who selected the online version rather
  than a traditional version. We compared the demographics, outcomes, and experiences
  of these students to the 715 students in the traditional version. We found the online
  students more likely to be older; to be underrepresented minorities; and to have
  previously failed a CS class. We then found that our online students attained comparable
  learning outcomes to students in the traditional section. Finally, we found that
  our online students perceived the online course quality more positively and required
  less time to achieve those comparable learning outcomes.
