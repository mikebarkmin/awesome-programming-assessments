abstract: 'Choices learners make when navigating a self-directed online learning tool
  can impact the effectiveness of the experience. But these tools often do not afford
  learners the agency or the information to make decisions beneficial to their learning.
  We evaluated the effect of varying levels of information and agency in a self-directed
  environment designed to teach programming. We investigated three design alternatives:
  informed high-agency, informed low-agency, and less informed high-agency. To investigate
  the effect of these alternatives on learning, we conducted a study with 79 novice
  programmers. Our results indicated that increased agency and information may have
  translated to more motivation, but not improved learning. Qualitative results suggest
  this was due to the burden that agency and information placed on decision-making.
  We interpret our results in relation to informing the design of self-directed online
  tools for learner agency.'
