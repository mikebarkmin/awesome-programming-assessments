abstract: This paper discusses the results of replicating and extending a study performed
  by Cooper et al. examining the relationship between students' spatial skills and
  their success in learning to program. Whereas Cooper et al. worked with high school
  students participating in a summer program, we worked with college students taking
  an introductory computing course. Like Cooper et al.'s study, we saw a correlation
  between a student's spatial skills and their success in learning computing. More
  significantly, we saw that after applying an intervention to teach spatial skills,
  students demonstrated improved performance both on a standard spatial skills assessment
  as well as on a CS content instrument. We also saw a correlation between students'
  enjoyment in computing and improved performance both on a standard spatial skills
  assessment and on a CS content instrument, a result not observed by Cooper et al.
