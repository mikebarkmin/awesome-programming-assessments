abstract: 'beginabstract Cognitive tests have been long used as a measure of student
  knowledge, ability, and as a predictor for success in engineering and computer science.
  However, these tests are not without their own problems relating to priming, difficulty
  (resulting in test fatigue) and time on exam. This paper discusses efforts to modify
  Parker et al.''s Second CS1 aptitude test (SCS1) citeParker16 to reduce the time
  spent on the exam, provide greater customization to match concepts taught across
  three universities, and reduce redundancy of test questions all while maintaining
  the instrument''s reliability. This instrument was modified for use on an ongoing
  grant investigating whether spatial abilities impact the success of students in
  introductory CS courses. The instrument developed in this paper is a revised shortened
  version of Second Computer Science 1 (SCS1) aptitude test, designated as SCS1R.
