abstract: 'A Concept Inventory (CI) is a set of multiple choice questions used to
  reveal student''s misconceptions related to some topic. Each available choice (besides
  the correct choice) is a distractor that is carefully developed to address a specific
  misunderstanding, a student wrong thought. In computer science introductory programming
  courses, the development of CIs is still beginning, with many topics requiring further
  study and analysis. We identify, through analysis of open-ended exams and instructor
  interviews, introductory programming course misconceptions related to function parameter
  use and scope, variables, recursion, iteration, structures, pointers and boolean
  expressions. We categorize these misconceptions and define high-quality distractors
  founded in words used by students in their responses to exam questions. We discuss
  the difficulty of assessing introductory programming misconceptions independent
  of the syntax of a language and we present a detailed discussion of two pilot CIs
  related to parameters: an open-ended question (to help identify new misunderstandings)
  and a multiple choice question with suggested distractors that we identified.'
