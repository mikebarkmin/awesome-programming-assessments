abstract: This is the 23rd Self-Assessment Procedure.1 The purpose of this procedure
  is to let its readers test their knowledge of some of the more important features
  of significant programming languages. The features of imperative languages like
  Fortran, Algol 60, PL/I, Pascal, Modula-2, C, and Ada considered are data types,
  data structures, control structures, program units, scope of names, and parameter
  passing. Some of the corresponding features of functional languages like Lisp, logic
  programming languages like Prolog, and ohject-oriented programming languages like
  C++ and Smalltalk, are reviewed. Finally brief consideration is given to syntax
  and semantics, chiefly by reference to the Backus-Naur form, BNF. The features of
  programming languages affect all aspects of programming, including the ease of writing
  and maintaining programs, the reliahility of software, and the efficiency and portability
  of programs. Knowledge of programming language concepts and constructs is of importance
  to software developers, programmers, and designers of programming languages and
  compilers. The topic of this procedure should be of interest to any computer science
  student or practitioner who wishes to test his or her knowledge and learn more about
  one of the most important and broad areas in the computer field. The language used
  most often in the questions is Pascal, with Ada, Lisp, and Prolog also featured
  prominently. A glossary is included which defines some of the terms used in the
  procedure. The questions are either multiple-choice or short answer. Some of the
  multiple-choice questions allow for more than one correct answer.
