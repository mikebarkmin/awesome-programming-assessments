abstract: In this paper, we report on an approach taken addressing the issue of the
  preparedness of students entering CS1. Specifically, we discuss the adoption of
  a first-day assessment test in lieu of completed course prerequisites for determining
  students' preparedness, and the development of a corresponding CS0 "fallback" course
  intended to provide the appropriate background for those students lacking the necessary
  programming reasoning skills, as indicated by assessment test results. We report
  here on the adequacy of the assessment test designed, the effectiveness of the CS0
  course as targeted for CS1 success, and the perceptions of students as to the impact
  that the CS0 course has had on their ultimate success in CS1.
