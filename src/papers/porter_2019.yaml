abstract: 'A Concept Inventory (CI) is a validated assessment to measure student conceptual
  understanding of a particular topic. This work presents a CI for Basic Data Structures
  (BDSI) and the process by which the CI was designed and validated. We discuss: 1)
  the collection of faculty opinions from diverse institutions on what belongs on
  the instrument, 2) a series of interviews with students to identify their conceptions
  and misconceptions of the content, 3) an iterative design process of developing
  draft questions, conducting interviews with students to ensure the questions on
  the instrument are interpreted properly, and collecting faculty feedback on the
  questions themselves, and 4) a statistical evaluation of final versions of the instrument
  to ensure its internal validity. We also provide initial results from pilot runs
  of the CI.'
