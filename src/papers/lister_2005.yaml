abstract: This paper presents a multiple choice question exam, used to test students
  completing their first semester of programming. Assumptions in the design of the
  exam are identified. A detailed analysis is performed on how students performed
  on the questions. The intent behind this exercise is to begin a community process
  of identifying the criteria that define an effective multiple-choice exam for testing
  novice programmers. The long term aim is to develop consensus on peer review criteria
  of such exams. This consensus is seen as a necessary precondition for any future
