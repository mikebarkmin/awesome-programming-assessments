abstract: Computing academics report bimodal grade distributions in their CS1 classes.
  Some academics believe that such a distribution is due to their being an innate
  talent for programming, a "geek gene". Robins introduced the concept of learning
  edge momentum, which offers an alternative explanation for the purported bimodal
  grade distribution. In this paper, we analyze empirical data from a real introductory
  programming class, looking for evidence of geek genes, learning edge momentum and
  other possible factors.
