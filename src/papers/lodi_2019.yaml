abstract: 'Many arguments are used to advocate for the introduction of Computer Science
  (CS) / Computational Thinking / "coding" in K-12 education. Growth mindset theory
  (GM) is also becoming very popular among educators and researchers. Some claims
  stating that studying CS can foster a GM have emerged. However, educational research
  shows that transfer of competences is hard. Very little research has been conducted
  on the relationship between GM and CS learning, with conflicting results. We measured
  some indicators (e.g., mindset, computer science mindset) at the beginning and the
  end of a high school year in five different classes: three CS oriented, one Chemistry
  oriented, and one Transportation&Logistics oriented. In one of the CS oriented classes,
  we did a very brief GM intervention. At the end of the school year, none of the
  classes showed a statistically significant change in their mindset. Interestingly,
  non-CS oriented classes showed a significant decrease in their computer science
  growth mindset. In the intervention class, students suggested, to stimulate a GM,
  the need for activities that are more creative, engaging, and related to the real
  world and their interests.'
