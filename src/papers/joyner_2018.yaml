abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) may reach a massive number of people,
  but few MOOCs count for credit. Scaling rigorous assessment, feedback, and integrity
  checks presents difficulties. We implemented an AI system for a CS1 MOOC-for-credit
  to address both scale and endorsement. In this analysis, we present the design of
  the system and an evaluation of the course. We observe that students in the online
  course achieve comparable learning outcomes, report a more positive student experience,
  and identify AI-equipped programming problems as the primary contributor to their
  experiences.
