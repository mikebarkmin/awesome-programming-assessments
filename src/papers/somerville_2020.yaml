abstract: 'Teaching an introductory programming course is beset by two core challenges:
  students enter the course with different levels of prior experience; and, for whatever
  reason, they progress at different rates. This is at odds with a typical face-to-face
  course, where material is delivered to the whole class in a lock-step fashion. Addressing
  these two challenges lies at the heart of an eight-week Summer School, described
  here, designed to bring a broad intake of students up to a common level ready to
  start on an degree apprenticeship programme that assumes a certain level of programming
  ability at the outset.A programming test of students'' understanding of programming
  constructs (e.g. conditional logic, loops, methods etc) allowed us to select for
  whom the course was mandatory, but it was open to all. Successful completion of
  the Summer School required students to demonstrate mastery of nine competencies.
  Each competency had an initial test, if the student did not meet the required level
  they were asked to complete coursework using Jupyter Notebooks. If the student passed
  the initial test they moved straight to the final test and if they passed, they
  moved to the next competency. There were also practice quizzes for students to do
  before the final test. This provided an individualised learning pathway for the
  students.Students improved in the programming test and have given favourable reviews
  of the Summer School in a focus group.'
