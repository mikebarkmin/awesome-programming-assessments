abstract: Computing education lags other discipline-based education research in the
  number and range of validated assessments available to the research community. Validated
  assessments are important for researchers to reduce experimental error due to flawed
  assessments and to allow for comparisons between different experiments. Although
  the need is great, building assessments from scratch is difficult. Once an assessment
  is built, it's important to be able to replicate it, in order to address problems
  within it, or to extend it. We developed the Second CS1 Assessment (SCS1) as an
  isomorphic version of a previously validated language-independent assessment for
  introductory computer science, the FCS1. Replicating the FCS1 is important to enable
  free use by a broader research community. This paper is documentation of our process
  for replicating an existing validated assessment and validating the success of our
  replication. We present initial use of SCS1 by other research groups, to serve as
  examples of where it might be used in the future. SCS1 is useful for researchers,
  but care must be taken to avoid undermining the validity argument.
