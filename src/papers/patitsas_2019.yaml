abstract: Although it has never been rigorously demonstrated, there is a common belief
  that grades in computer science courses are bimodal. We statistically analyzed 778
  distributions of final course grades from a large research university and found
  that only 5.8% of the distributions passed tests of multimodality. We then devised
  a psychology experiment to understand why CS educators believe their grades to be
  bimodal. We showed 53 CS professors a series of histograms displaying ambiguous
  distributions that we asked them to categorize. A random half of participants were
  primed to think about the fact that CS grades are commonly thought to be bimodal;
  these participants were more likely to label ambiguous distributions as "bimodal."
  Participants were also more likely to label distributions as bimodal if they believed
  that some students are innately predisposed to do better at CS. These results suggest
  that bimodal grades are instructional folklore in CS, caused by confirmation bias
  and instructor beliefs about their students.
