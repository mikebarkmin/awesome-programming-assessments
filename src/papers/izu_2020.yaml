abstract: 'This study explores novice programmers'' abilities to design and code a
  string manipulation task in C after one semester of tertiary instruction. String
  manipulation is an important skill for novice programmers to master as most applications
  deal with text and/or interact with the user. The analysis shows most novice programmers
  (88%) were able to sketch their own programming plan to print a word in pyramid
  style. 53% of students chose to control the printing letter by letter (character
  level) and 32% updated and printed the word as a whole (string level). However only
  6% used string functions, apart from strlen() and strcmp(), to implement their plan.
  This indicated a low level of transfer from their most recent class activity which
  focused on the C string library. As expected, not all succeeded to correctly implement
  their plan: 56% were correct at character level and 63% at string level, resulting
  in 49% of the whole cohort completing the task. Their code has been thoroughly analysed
  to identify implementation issues, and logical, syntax and plan errors are reported
  and discussed.'
