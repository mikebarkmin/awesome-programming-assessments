abstract: 'The research in both cognitive load theory and multimedia principles for
  learning indicates presenting information using both diagrams and accompanying audio
  explanations yields better learning performance than using diagrams with text explanations.
  While this is a common practice in introductory programming courses, often called
  "live coding," it has yet to be empirically tested. This paper reports on an experiment
  to determine if auditory explanations of code result in improved learning performance
  over written explanations. Students were shown videos explaining short code segments
  one of three ways: text only explanations, auditory only explanations, or both text
  and auditory explanations, thus replicating experiments from other domains. The
  results from this study do not support the findings from other disciplines and we
  offer explanations for why this may be the case.'
