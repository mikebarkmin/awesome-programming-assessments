abstract: Socioeconomic status (SES) has a measurable impact on many educational outcomes
  and likely also influences computer science (CS) achievement. We present a novel
  model to account for the observed connections between SES and CS achievement. We
  examined possible mediating variables between SES and CS achievement, including
  spatial ability and access to computing. We define access as comprised of measurements
  of prior learning opportunities for computing, perceptions of computer science,
  and encouragement to pursue computing. The factors (SES, spatial ability, access
  to computing, and CS achievement) were measured through surveys completed by 163
  students in introductory computing courses at a college level. Through the use of
  exploratory structural equation modeling, we found that these variables do impact
  each other, though not as we originally hypothesized. For our sample of students,
  we found spatial ability was a mediating variable for SES and CS achievement, but
  access to computing was not. Neither model explained all the variance, and our subject
  pool of US college students had higher than average SES. Our findings suggest that
  SES does influence success in computer science, but that relationship may not be
  due to access to computing education opportunities. Rather, SES might be influencing
  variables such as spatial ability which in turn influence CS performance.
