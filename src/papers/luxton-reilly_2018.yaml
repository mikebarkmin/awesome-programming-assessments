abstract:
  Current learning outcomes for introductory programming courses are relatively
  general, specifying tasks such as designing, implementing, testing and debugging
  programs that use some fundamental programming constructs. These outcomes impact
  what we teach, our expectations, and our assessments. Although prior work has demonstrated
  the utility of single concept assessments, most assessments used in formal examinations
  combine numerous heterogeneous concepts, resulting in complex and difficult tasks.  As
  a consequence, teachers may not be able to diagnose the actual difficulties faced
  by students and students are not provided with accurate feedback about their achievements.
  Such limitations on the nature and quality of feedback to teachers and students
  alike may contribute to the perceived difficulty and high dropout rates commonly
  observed in introductory programming courses.  In this paper we review the concepts
  that Computer Science education researchers have identified as important for novice
  programming. We survey expected learning outcomes for introductory programming courses,
  and analyse assessments designed for such courses to determine the individual components
  of syntax and semantics required to complete them. Having recognized the implicit
  and explicit expectations of novice programming courses, we look at the relationships
  between components, and progression between concepts. Finally, we demonstrate how
  some complex assessments can be decomposed into atomic elements that can be assessed
  independently.
