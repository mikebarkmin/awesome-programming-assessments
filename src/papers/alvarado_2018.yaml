abstract: Many college computer science majors have little or no pre-college computing
  experience. Previous work has shown that inexperienced students under-perform their
  experienced peers when placed in the same introductory courses, and are more likely
  to drop out of the CS program. However, not much is known about what, if any, differences
  may persist beyond the introductory sequence for students who remain in the program.
  We conducted a study across all levels of a CS program at a large public university
  in the United States to determine whether grade differences exist between students
  with and without pre-college experience, and if so, for what types of experiences.
  We find significant grade differences in courses at all levels of the program. We
  further find that students who took AP Computer Science receive significantly higher
  average grades---by up to a half grade---in nearly all courses we studied. Pre-college
  experience appears to have a weaker relationship with retention and with low-stakes
  assessment grades. We discuss the limitations of these findings and implications
  for high school and college level CS courses and programs.
