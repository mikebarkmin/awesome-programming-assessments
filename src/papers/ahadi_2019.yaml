abstract: Several systems that collect data from students' problem solving processes
  exist. Within computing education research, such data has been used for multiple
  purposes, ranging from assessing students' problem solving strategies to detecting
  struggling students. To date, however, the majority of the analysis has been conducted
  by individual researchers or research groups using case by case methodologies.Our
  belief is that with increasing possibilities for data collection from students'
  learning process, researchers and instructors will benefit from ready-made analysis
  tools.In this study, we present ArAl, an online machine learning based platform
  for analyzing programming source code snapshot data. The benefit of ArAl is two-fold.
  The computing education researcher can use ArAl to analyze the source code snapshot
  data collected from their own institute. Also, the website provides a collection
  of well-documented machine learning and statistics based tools to investigate possible
  correlation between different variables. The presented web-portal is available at
  online-analysis-demo.herokuapp.com. This tool could be applied in many different
  subject areas given appropriate performance data.
