abstract: 'In January 2017, a major public research university launched an online
  version of CS1 targeted at on-campus students to address rising enrollments and
  provide students with flexibility in their schedules. Prior research on this class
  has found positive outcomes: students in the course achieve the same learning outcomes
  as those in a traditional course, while reporting a lower time investment to reach
  those outcomes and a high level of student satisfaction. This research builds on
  that prior work in two ways. First, it replicates the findings from that earlier
  semester with an entirely new semester of students. Second, it delves deeper into
  the student experience within the online course and its traditional counterpart.
  This deeper analysis focuses specifically on the differing ways in which students
  in each section allocated their time, whether or not students in either section
  accessed the opposite section''s material, and their future preferences in online
  vs. residential CS classes.'
