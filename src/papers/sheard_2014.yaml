abstract: This paper reports on the combining of two related but hitherto distinct
  themes in programming education research. The first is the recognition that students
  in programming courses tend to perform far more poorly than their teachers would
  like, and further, more poorly than their teachers would expect without a careful
  analysis of their results. The second is the proposal of a number of different styles
  of examination question, sometimes coupled with analysis of student performance
  on those questions, typically at single institutions. This work combines these themes
  by including a common set of short questions in the final examinations of introductory
  programming courses at six institutions in Australia and New Zealand, and analysing
  the student performance across all six institutions. The analysis results in a set
  of four simple questions that can be used to benchmark student performance in introductory
  programming courses at a wide range of institutions.
