abstract: The automated design of a set of practice problems that co-adapts to a population
  of learners is a challenging problem. Fortunately, coevolutionary computation offers
  a rich framework to study interactions between two co-adapting populations of teachers
  and learners. This framework is also relevant in scenarios in which a population
  of students solve practice exercises that are synthesized by an evolutionary algorithm.
  In this study, we propose to leverage coevolutionary optimization to evolve a population
  of Parsons puzzles (a relatively recent new type of practice exercise for novice
  computer programmers). To this end, we start by experimenting with successive simulations
  that progressively introduce the characteristics that we anticipate finding in our
  target application. Using these simulations, we refine a set of guidelines that
  capture insights on how to successfully coevolve Parsons puzzles. These guidelines
  are then used to implement the proposed ``EvoParsons'' software, with which we conduct
  preliminary evaluations on real human students enrolled in an introductory Java
  programming course at the University of South Florida. We also propose several quantitative
  metrics to assess the quality of puzzles produced by EvoParsons. Both simulations
  and experiments establish the feasibility of evolving pedagogically relevant practice
  problems that cover most of the dimensions underlying the interactions between problems
  and students. In addition, a generation-by-generation detailed analysis of the evolving
  population of Parsons puzzles confirms the occurrence of incremental improvements
  that can be explained in pedagogical terms.
