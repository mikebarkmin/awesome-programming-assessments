abstract: The learning of programming can take manifold starting points, e.g. via
  friends or family, a school course, a compulsory requirement in vocational education
  (e.g. industrial robotics) or even in an academic setting (e.g. formalization and
  execution of mathematical algorithms in numerical mathematics). Within these approaches,
  context-specific programming languages are used, which might support different paradigms.
  In this paper, a proposal for a language and paradigm overarching competency structure
  model is developed from theoretical considerations. By analyzing different programming
  languages, textbooks and papers three content dimensions are derived. Principles
  and the application of high-Level paradigms build the first dimension. The second
  dimension elements represents paradigm and language independent concepts of program
  components, data types, basic data structures and algorithmic paradigms. The last
  content dimension language is defined by syntax, semantics, standard library and
  the build/compile and run process of programming languages.
